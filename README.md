# Workbook starter repo

## Story

Tech interview workbook is the basis of the preparation for the tech
interview. We gathered questions you could expect on real tech
interviews (and therefore on the trial tech interview in the advanced
module).

During your Journey throughout Codecoool your job is to fill the
answers in your own workbook. We believe that thinking about, and
writing the the answers will help you to understand the material
better than reading those in a book.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to write answers to technical questions
- Markdown formatting

## Tasks



## General requirements

- There are no rendering errors in the online view.  (See hints)
- The questions are moved into groups.  There is a group created for each week for the module.
- Questions can be moved around. - This separation can be revised later.

## Hints

### Rendering the workbook

**github**: By browsing the markdown files on the web view of github the markdown is rendered into html.

**using python**: On the root directory of the project issue the command:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

And point your browser to <http://localhost:3000/>
